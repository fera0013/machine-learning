Please note, that the project was implemented using the Quantopian research environment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TlWzwM208&feature=youtu.be).
Since several of the functions used in this project (specifically the functions to obtain the market data) are Quantopian API methods, the notebook only runs in this research environment.
The hosted notebook can be found under https://www.quantopian.com/research/notebooks/Q-Learning%20Trading%20Agent.ipynb.
